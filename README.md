Ambulant is a website which uses a complex algorithm to determine the optimal sleep time and times for a user to go on a walk. The website uses a sophisticated artificial intelligence framework developed by amateur coders from the Noble and Greenough institution as a medium for enhancing the personal health, life, and well-being of its users in a post-pandemic world. The website has a stunningly-simple, responsive design that will leave you in awe of our amateur developer team’s incredible work. Fortunately, the website requires cookies and does not work on local files on Chrome but it works if it is hosted. This may seem like a design flaw; however, this was a carefully thought-out and scrutinized decision, as our data collection task force came to the conclusion that releasing our product solely on non-Chrome browsers is the optimal market strategy. 

Sharks, we’re seeking a $200,000,000.01 investment for a .000005% stake (evaluation per Deutsche Bank, c. 2021) in our enterprise. Additionally, we will offer a ¢0.05 royalty for each account sold in the first two fiscal years of our business. Sharks, we hope you’ll help us put the A in Ambulant.
